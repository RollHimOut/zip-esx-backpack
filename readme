Overview of the Script
Still missing model for backpack to load on player & a few other thinfs i will finish. 
	1.	Features:
	•	Backpack as a usable item.
	•	Opens a secondary inventory (linked to the backpack ID).
	•	Persistent storage of backpack items in the database.
	•	Restricts players to carrying only one backpack at a time.
	2.	Requirements:
	•	ox_inventory (fully set up and running).
	•	A MySQL database (ensure oxmysql or mysql-async is properly installed).
	3.	Files Provided:
	•	config.lua – Configuration for the backpack.
	•	server.lua – Handles database saving, loading, and logic.
	•	client.lua – Manages client-side interactions with the backpack.
	4.	SQL Setup:
	•	A new table for backpack storage.

1. SQL Table for Backpack Items

Run the following SQL query to create a table for storing backpack inventories:

CREATE TABLE backpack_inventory (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    backpack_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    item_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    item_count INT NOT NULL,
    metadata JSON DEFAULT NULL
);


-- Adding the Backpack Item

-- In your ox_inventory item config add the backpack item:

['backpack'] = {
    label = 'Backpack',
    weight = 1.0, -- Weight of the backpack itself
    stack = false, -- Backpacks should not stack
    close = true, -- Close inventory when used
    description = 'A handy backpack for storing additional items.',
    client = {
        event = 'backpack:useItem',
    },
}

Selling the Backpack from a Shop


['backpack'] = {
    price = 250, -- Example price
    amount = 10, -- Stock
}

How It Works

	1.	Use the Backpack Item:
	•	Players use the backpack item to equip it.
	•	A unique stash ID is generated for the player.
	2.	Open Backpack Inventory:
	•	When used, it opens a stash linked to the backpack.
	3.	Save Items:
	•	Items stored in the backpack persist in the database using ox_inventory:saveInventory.
	4.	Load Items:
	•	When opening the backpack, the script fetches stored items from the database.
	5.	Restrict Extra Backpacks:
	•	Prevents players from equipping more than one backpack.
